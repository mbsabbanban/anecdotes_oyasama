However, when in the same year pain returned to Shuji\'s leg, becoming so acute that he had to be moved on a stretcher, Oyasama breathed on his leg and applied a piece of paper to the affected area.

Seeing His Heart','\"In 1852, Okoyo, the elder sister of Chusaku Tsuji of Toyoda Village, while going to the Residence for sewing lessons from Oyasama, noticed an especially gentle nature in Okimi, the third daughter of Oyasama. Because the mother of Sojiro Kajimoto was from the Tsuji family, Okoyo recommended Okimi highly to the Kajimoto family of Ichinomoto. The Kajimoto family accepted the idea and proposed marriage between Okimi and Sojiro. Chusaku Tsuji was to act as matchmaker. To this proposal Oyasama replied:\"\"If it is Sojiro, there is no need for a meeting between the two. I see the fine quality of his heart. Take her.\"\"Thus, the marriage of Okimi and Sojiro was happily arranged. After the marriage, Okimi changed her name to Oharu.It is said that Sojiro was called \"\"Sojiro the Buddha\"\" by the villagers because he had been a kind and gentle person from childhood.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 2-3',2,NULL),(7,7,'7.

One day at the end of the year, a follower brought some small, beautifully made rice cakes in the finest of boxes and said, \"\"Please, offer this to Oyasama.\"\" Kokan, Oyasama\'s youngest daughter, promptly took it to Her. Oddly, Oyasama only said:\"\"Oh, is that so?\"\"and did not seem to be particularly pleased.About two or three days later another follower came. She brought out a package in a plain kerchief and said, \"\"Please, will you offer this to Oyasama?\"\" In it were only a few sweetened rice cakes in a bamboo wrapping. Kokan as usual took it to Oyasama. Thereupon, Oyasama said:\"\"Please, offer it to God the Parent at once,\"\"and seemed very pleased.The following fact became known later. The follower who had brought the finely made cakes was well to do. She had made some rice cakes for New Year\'s, and as there were some left over, she took them to the Residence as an afterthought. The follower who had brought the plain cakes was poor, and barely able to make enough rice cakes for New Year\'s. However, her family said, \"\"This is also the blessing of God the Parent. First of all, let us make an offering.\"\" They took the first freshly made rice cakes to the Residence.Oyasama had known what was in the heart of each of these two persons.There were many such incidents. Later, many followers began to bring the rare seasonal foods grown in their localities to Oyasama when they visited Her. Oyasama always appreciated the sincere heart with which the followers brought these offerings more than the offerings themselves.Further, when things were presented to Her with arrogance, She often gave them to those nearby. When, on occasion, She did eat them, She said:\"\"It has no taste at all. It tastes as though we are forcing ourselves to eat when we do not want to eat.\"\"\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 3-4',3,NULL),(8,8,'8. By a Slight Illness','\"On May 6, 1861, Koto Nishida had a toothache. She left home to visit an Inari temple in Senzoku. Senzoku lies to the north of her house, but she was walking to the east without intending to do so, and happened to meet a friend of about the same age. This friend had married into the Okuda family in Bessho. She asked Koto where she was going, and then told her that if she would pay a visit to Shoyashiki, any illness could be cured. So Koto made a pilgrimage to Shoyashiki at once. She arrived toward evening. Oyasama greeted her:\"\"Welcome home. I have been waiting for you.\"\"Further:\"\"I have given you guidance by a slight illness only.\"\"Then, telling her the divine teachings, Oyasama gave her the sacred powder of roasted grain. By the time Koto got home after listening to the divine teachings, the toothache had completely stopped. She did not pay a visit to Shoyashiki for some days. Then, her eyes began to hurt violently. Immediately, she visited Oyasama, who said to her:\"\"I have given you guidance through an illness.\"\"Oyasama taught Koto the divine teachings step by step, and prayed for her. The pain stopped by the time Koto left to go home.For the following three days Koto visited Shoyashiki to clean the Residence, bringing her lunch with her. That was the beginning of her faith in Tenrikyo. Koto was thirty-two years old that year.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 4-5',4,NULL),(9,9,'9.

Oyasama saw them and said:\"\"His parents should bring him instead.\"\"So Masu, Chusaku\'s wife, carrying the boy on her back, came to pray.\"\"I will save the child according to the parents\' minds,\"\"was the teaching of Oyasama. The boy was completely restored to health in four or five days. \"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 5 ',5,NULL),(10,10,'10. The Long Way Around','\"In 1863, when Kiku Masui was thirty-nine years old, her husband, Isaburo, caught a slight cold. It developed into a stubborn case of asthma. Kiku was so religious by nature that she visited almost all the places of pilgrimage and worship within eight or twelve kilometers of their house in order to pray for her husband\'s recovery. Still, he did not get well.Then, Senkichi Yaoi, a next-door neighbor, advised her, \"\"Kiku, you seem to have been to various places of worship one after another. Now, why don\'t you go to the god in Shoyashiki?\"\" Kiku felt as if she were being drawn to God by an invisible string, and she hurried to Jiba* at once. The seasonable time had come for her.When Kiku was admitted into Oyasama\'s room, Oyasama said warmly:\"\"I have been waiting for you, waiting for you,\"\"as if welcoming Her own child who had come home from afar. Then Kiku said, \"\"I have been to so many places to pray until now.\"\" Oyasama said:\"\"You have come the long way around. What a pity! You could have met all those gods if only you had come here,\"\"and She smiled gently. When Kiku heard these words, she felt that Oyasama was truly the Parent. She was deeply impressed and moved by an inexpressible feeling of adoration which penetrated into her heart.(Note)* The Residence\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 5-6',5,NULL),(11,11,'11. God Has Drawn You to this Residence','\"It was about the middle of January 1864 when Chushichi Yamanaka was thirty-eight years of age. Chushichi\'s wife, Sono, had been suffering from severe hemorrhoids for over two years. Her condition became so critical that for several days she could not even drink any liquids. Two doctors had given up hope of recovery. Just about this time, Chushichi learned about the teachings of God from Seibei of Shiba Village. He immediately returned to the Residence* and was granted an audience with Oyasama. She said:\"\"You have an innen** with God and God has drawn you to this Residence. You need not worry about your wife\'s condition. I will save her in an instant, but in return, you must be willing to serve God.\"\"(Notes)* In Tenrikyo, Jiba, or the Residence, is the place of Creation. Therefore, it is said that a person \'returns\' to Jiba even if it is the first time that he goes there in his life.** Innen: literally \"\"destiny\"\" or \"\"cause and effect.\"\" Man\'s original innen is to live a joyous life.

The Sazuke (Divine Grant) of Fertilizer','\"Oyasama said to Chushichi Yamanaka:\"\"As you are following the path of God, in your farming you must not have enough time to fertilize sufficiently,\"\"and then She bestowed the Sazuke* of Fertilizer on Chushichi. She continued:\"\"Concerning the Sazuke of Fertilizer, it is not the substance itself, but the truly sincere mind of each person which is effective.\"\"Further, She said:\"\"True or false, try it and see.\"\"As soon as Chushichi got home, he chose two fields and fertilized one sufficiently with the usual night soil, fertilized the other only with the Sazuke of Fertilizer, and decided to wait for the result.Soon, August passed and September came to an end. The field fertilized with the night soil became thick with green rice plants which promised a rich harvest in the fall. On the other hand, the field fertilized with the Sazuke of Fertilizer seemed lifeless. The stalks were short and stubby and they had turned a slightly reddish color. Chushichi could not help but doubt, \"\"After all, it seems like the night soil is more effective than the sazuke.\"\"However, at autumn harvest time, the rice plants from the usually fertilized field were infested with insects and some were even empty. In contrast, none of the rice plants from the field of the sazuke were infested with insects and none were empty, although the stalks were a little shorter. It was discovered that the sazuke field actually yielded more rice at harvest time.(Note)* Sazuke: a divine grant for salvation bestowed by God the Parent. When it is administered to any person suffering from a physical or mental illness, the person is saved and given the marvelous blessing of God the Parent.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 7-8',7,NULL),(13,13,'13. Sow the Seed','\"Tosuke Maeda and his wife Tatsu of Anryu Village, Settsu Province, were peddling flower seeds under the name of Taneichi. They had had many children one after another, and they did not want to have more. But in 1865, Tatsu was again expecting a baby. Then Tatsu heard of a god in Yamato Province who would bring about an abortion, and so she went there. However, she did not arrive at the place of that god, but was guided by an unknown force to Shoyashiki Village. There she was granted an audience with Oyasama, who said:\"\"You are the Taneichi (literally, \'seed market\'), so you will sow seeds.\"\"What do you mean by sowing seeds? asked Tatsu. Then Oyasama taught:\"\"It means to go here and there and talk of Tenri-O.\"\"*Referring to the expected baby, Oyasama added:\"\"It will not do to abort the child. The baby will be a boy, the heir to the Maeda family.\"\"These words struck home to Tatsu and convinced her of giving up having an abortion. When she returned home, she told her husband Tosuke of Oyasama\'s words and he too was convinced. From that time on they often returned to Jiba and received teachings from Oyasama. The baby was born on June 18th of that year and was named Tojiro.Both husband and wife told people of the divine name of Tenri-O-no-Mikoto wherever they went to sell their flower seeds. Moreover, when they met a sick person, either the wife or husband would return to Jiba to pray for that person. All the sick people they prayed for were saved.(Note)* God the Parent\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 8-9',8,NULL),(14,14,'14. Dyeing','\"One day Oyasama instructed:\"\"Do the dyeing tomorrow morning.\"\"Kokan immediately began to make preparations. Just that evening, Chushichi Yamanaka in Mamekoshi learned of it through the Invocation of the Fan. His wife, Sono, immediately made preparations, woke up early the next morning before daybreak, and returned to the Residence with some earth* and pieces of cloth in a bundle over her back. She greeted Oyasama and told Her the reason for returning.\"\"Ah! That\'s marvelous! Just last night my daughter, Kokan, and I were talking about the same thing,\"\"Oyasama said, and was delighted. Similar incidents occurred several times.The dyeing was done with water from the well northeast of the very place which was later determined as the Jiba, where the Kanrodai was to be erected.\"\"Draw water from the well,\"\"Oyasama said. So water was drawn from the well. The earth was rubbed on the cloth and the cloth was soaked in water. It was soaked and dried, and dried and soaked two or three times until the dyed material became a beautiful binroji** color. The water from the well had a metallic taste.***(Notes)* When Oyasama visited the home of Chushichi Yamanaka in August 1865, She noticed that the earth from the bank of the stream which ran along the east side of the house would be suitable for dyeing. She therefore expressed a desire to have some of it. Thereafter, that earth was brought to the Residence many times. It is said that the earth was from a compost of bamboo leaves in the bamboo forest.** Binroji refers to the nut of the betel palm tree which grows in India and Malaysia. In Japan, the meat of the nut was dried and used for dyeing, and produced a dark black color which was called \'the binroji color.\'*** In Yamato Province there were many wells with water that had a metallic taste. However, water from other wells did not produce as beautiful a dye as that from the Residence.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 9-10',9,NULL),(15,15,'15. These Seeds','\"Late at night on February 7, 1866, Oyasama, already in bed, suddenly said:\"\"Take out the crockery pot stored under the altar.\"\"When the pot was presented to Her, Oyasama called in Chushichi Yamanaka, and said to him:\"\"I have granted you various privileges until now. However, you might not be able to understand fully if I just tell you. You may worry about falling short of needs when you go along the divine path. You need not worry about anything. You will not be in want even if you wish to be. I will give you positive, positive, positive proof.\"\"Then Oyasama gave the crockery pot to him. She further instructed:\"\"Here are seeds which will multiply ten thousandfold. Sow these at your residence, Chushichi of Mamekoshi Village.\"\"On the following day, when Chushichi went to thank Her, Oyasama was pleased to see him and said:\"\"This grant is the treasure of your family and of the path. You must be very happy!\"\"He had been granted a list and four seeds. The list read: wheat ? six kilograms, rice ? about seventeen kilograms, personal allowance ? sixty kan* and sake ? about eleven liters. These were granted as eternal seeds. Each of the four seeds was a six centimeter square, white paper packet which was bound on four sides with white string. On the face of each packet respectively was written: \"\"seed of wheat,\"\" \"\"seed of rice,\"\" \"\"money for medicine,\"\" and \"\"money for wine and seed of oil.\"\" Oyasama Herself wrote these words with a writing brush. She also bound the packets with string, chanting:\"\"Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto, Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto.\"\"It was witnessed that the string did not go through if She stopped chanting. Thus, She gave him the proof that he would never be hard-pressed for the needs of life as long as he followed the path.(Note)* Sixty kan = about 320 U. S. dollars.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 10-11',10,NULL),(16,16,'16. The Child\'s Concern for the Parent','\"Kiku, mother of Isaburo Masui, became ill. Her condition gradually worsened and reached the critical stage. After waiting impatiently for daybreak, Isaburo left Izushichijo Village early in the morning and, walking about five and a half kilometers, he returned to the Residence. When he was received by Oyasama, he asked, \"\"Please, save my mother from her illness.\"\" Oyasama replied:\"\"I am sorry, Isaburo, in spite of your request she cannot be saved.\"\"As this reply came from Oyasama Herself, he excused himself from Her presence, saying, \"\"I see, I understand,\"\" and returned home. However, when he saw his mother suffering from illness, he was overwhelmed with the thought, \"\"Oh, I want her to be saved at any cost.\"\"Therefore, he again returned to the Residence and asked earnestly, \"\"Please, I beg of you, I wish to have my mother saved however difficult it may be.\"\"Oyasama replied again:\"\"Isaburo, I am sorry, she cannot be saved.\"\"When Isaburo was so told by Oyasama, he was convinced for the time being that nothing could be done. However, when he came home and again saw his mother suffering, he could not bear to sit by and do nothing.So again, he trudged back the five and a half kilometers. When he arrived at the Residence it was already dark. He was told that Oyasama was already in bed, but he implored again, \"\"I understand that my mother cannot be saved but somehow, please, save her.\"\" Then, Oyasama said:\"\"The child comes for the sake of his parent to ask that the life, which cannot be saved, be saved at whatever cost. This is sincerity itself. If sincere, God will accept.\"\"With these gracious words, Kiku, Isaburo\'s mother, was saved from the life that could not be saved otherwise, and lived to be eighty-eight.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 11-12',11,NULL),(17,17,'17.

The Songs of Truth','\"When the sacred songs of twelve chapters were completed, Oyasama told Her attendants:\"\"These are the songs for the Service. Try singing them to the best tune you can find.\"\"Each of them sang to his own tune. After listening to it, Oyasama said:\"\"Thank you for your singing, but none of them will do. You should sing them this way.\"\"She sang loudly Herself. Then She told the attendants:\"\"These are the songs of truth. So you must dance to the truth. Try dancing the best way you can.\"\"Each of them arranged the dance and showed it to Oyasama. Afterward, She said:\"\"Thank you for your dancing, but no one danced to the truth. You should dance in this way. You should not just dance. You should dance the truth.\"\"So saying, She stood up and performed the dance movements Herself in order to teach the attendants.In this way, Oyasama Herself taught the singing and dancing after having all the attendants try on their own.This is the story told by Haru, wife of Ichibei Matsuo.Note: Haru Matsuo was born on September 15, 1835, and entered the faith in 1866.

This was how the songs were taught to the world for the first time. It took three years to teach the dance.Oyasama taught six persons how to dance, making the movements Herself with Her hands and arms, and repeating them three times. Three persons learned while the other three watched. Oyasama said nothing even if someone made a mistake.\"\"I would not put him to shame,\"\"is said to be Oyasama\'s comment. She taught every movement three times and completed the teaching in three years. While teaching, Oyasama would say:\"\"It is like children playing shuttlecock during the New Year\'s season, singing \'One, Two.\'\"\"*This is the story that Shirobei Umetani heard from a senior in the faith.(Note)* Refers to the counting of the songs in the Mikagura-uta\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 13-14',13,NULL),(20,20,'20.

Hurry home to them.\"\"Chushichi had not expected the baby to be born that soon, so he had stayed overnight at the Residence. Therefore, when Oyasama informed him of the birth he was half in doubt, but he acknowledged Her words, saying, \"\"Oh, I see, thank you.\"\" However, when he met his son, Hikoshichi, on the way and was told the news of the birth, he realized fully the truth of Oyasama\'s words.

Also, his rice fields of approximately ninety ares* were washed out.People in his village had been deriding Chushichi\'s faith and immediately seized the opportunity to heap all sorts of abuses on him, saying, \"\"Look at him! What a fool he is! Stupid one!\"\" Feeling chagrined at what the villagers said, Chushichi visited Oyasama in the Residence and explained the situation to Her. Oyasama told him:\"\"Sah, sah, that\'s all to the good. That\'s all to the good. Now that your goods have been carried away to the bottom of the sea, it will come to good in the future. You may wonder why your fields and hills were washed out in spite of your faith, but you must accept the situation with a heart of gratitude. You must do so.

Then God said, \'Brush, brush, take up the brush.\' I took the brush up for the first time at New Year\'s when I became seventy-two years old. And when I took the brush up, My hand moved by itself. From heaven, God did it. After what was to be done was finished, My hand became numb and it could not be moved. God said, \'Calm Your mind, and read this. If You find something You cannot understand, ask Me.\' I added brush strokes when I found something I could not understand.

Then She combed her hair, crushing one by one the lice which had bred during her long illness and fever.

During the bon festival season, he sang on festival towers in Nagataki, Chishawara, Kasa and other neighboring villages.In 1871, when he was nineteen years old, Hikotaro was told that he needed to expand the volume of his voice in order to produce truly wonderful sounds. So he practiced by a waterfall in Yokkawa, singing, \"\"Ko-o-rya! korya! korya!\"\" at the top of his lungs.As it was after the day\'s hard work in the fields, he invigorated himself by licking a paste made of charred vipers, soybeans and dried sesame. On the third night of the practice, he suddenly lost his sight. He had developed an eye disease, probably amaurosis.Guided by his mother, Hikotaro went to Hase, barefoot, to pray for the aid of the goddess Kannon. But his prayers were not answered at all. His mother, Shika, grieved at seeing his condition, said, \"\"You cannot see even the white chicken at your feet, can you?\"\" His condition remained unchanged for over three months. Then, he was told, \"\"There is a new god in Shoyashiki who is able to cure any illness. That god will save you in an instant.\"\"Before long, he returned to Jiba. When he was received by Oyasama, She gave him three packets of the sacred powder of roasted grain and said:\"\"I am glad you have come home. This world remains in complete darkness as long as you are blind. But you shall certainly be saved if you do as God tells you.\"\"Hikotaro answered, \"\"I cannot go on living like this. I will do anything if God will save me.\"\" Whereupon, Oyasama said:\"\"So, if that is your wish, do no worldly work. Go with God, and devote yourself to the salvation of man for the rest of your life.\"\"No sooner had he replied, \"\"I will do so,\"\" than his sight was slightly restored. Within a few days, he had completely recovered. From then on, with great joy he devoted himself day and night to spreading the fragrance of the words of God and saving others.

Before leaving the Residence, She had three small cups of sweet rice wine and three round pieces of raw eggplant.\"\"Let us start on our trip,\"\"She said. \"\"Please go on a litter,\"\" someone pleaded. She replied:\"\"Remember that this is a test,\"\"and, so saying, began to walk briskly. When She arrived at the Matsuo residence, Ichibei and his wife were so overjoyed that they were close to tears. Assuming that Oyasama was tired and exhausted after walking about sixteen kilometers while fasting, they had a hearty feast prepared for Her.\"\"What a tempting dinner! Thank you very much. I accept your kind thoughtfulness, and it fills my stomach. Please take away the dishes now, and bring me water and salt instead,\"\"She said. Ichibei\'s wife, Haru, thought that the dishes might not have been to Her liking, so she inquired about it.\"\"Each one of them is my favorite. They all look delicious,\"\"Oyasama replied. Whereupon Haru said, \"\"But you haven\'t touched anything. You ask for just water and salt, but I cannot do that.\"\"\"\"I am now fasting in accordance with God\'s will. My stomach is always full. I understand how you feel. Well, then why don\'t you take those chopsticks and try to feed me?\"\"Oyasama asked.Haru was pleased and she moved the tray in front of Oyasama. Haru picked up the bowl of rice in one hand and, using chopsticks, took some rice from it. Just as she was about to move the chopsticks toward Oyasama, who was waiting to be served, Haru\'s knees began to shake. The rice on the chopsticks, together with the bowl, suddenly dropped upon the tray. Bowing deeply before Oyasama, Haru humbly apologized. She withdrew the tray from in front of Oyasama, who was smiling, and brought another tray that she had prepared.\"\"Thank you very much for your trouble. Are you going to feed Me again?\"\"Oyasama said, opening Her mouth wide. Haru again picked up the bowl and took some rice with the chopsticks. As Haru moved her hand toward Oyasama\'s mouth, Haru\'s right thumb and index finger twitched painfully, and the chopsticks and rice fell on Oyasama\'s lap. Feeling deeply ashamed, Haru apologized for her repeated carelessness.\"\"I am thankful for your kind thoughts, but it will be the same no matter how many times you try. God has stopped you. So please take away the tray of dishes quickly,\"\"Oyasama said tenderly to console her.So Oyasama continued to fast during Her stay, and news of this reached the Residence. On the fifth day, three persons ? daughter Kokan, Iburi, and Yohei of Ichieda ? came from the Residence. Kokan asked Oyasama to have some food.\"\"You all think that I am not eating of my own accord, but it is not so. It is just that I cannot eat. If you think otherwise, try and feed me,\"\"Oyasama said. Kokan tried to feed Her, but the chopsticks jumped up and hung in the air. Witnessing this, everyone was convinced. So Oyasama\'s fasting continued to the day of Her return.Shuji came to take Oyasama home, and Ichibei decided to go with Shuji to borrow a litter from the Kohigashi family of Byodoji Village. They asked Oyasama to ride in the litter, and when they came to Tatsuta, Oyasama said:\"\"I feel dizzy.\"\"So they respected Her wish, and Oyasama began to walk. Oyasama explained:\"\"God has said, \'Do not ride in a litter. Walk.\' \"\"\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 18-20',18,NULL),(26,26,'26. The Story of Linen, Silk and Cotton','\"In 1872, while staying at the house of Matsuo, Oyasama said to the couple, Ichibei and Haru, when they came to greet Her one morning:\"\"Both of you always wear formal clothes when you come to see Me. From now on just wear your everyday clothes. Would it not be more comfortable for you?\"\"When the two bowed their heads in appreciation, She taught them the following:\"\"Today I will tell you the story of linen, silk and cotton.\"\"The linen lets the breeze go through freely and does not stick to the skin. Therefore, there is nothing cooler or better to wear in the summer. However, it is too cold to wear in the winter. It is just for the summer. After being worn for about three years, it begins to discolor. If it becomes completely discolored, it is worthless. Even when it is dyed into a darker shade, the color is uneven. When it reaches this stage, it is as useless as waste paper.\"\"Silk, whether made into a formal coat or a kimono, is elegant. It is something everybody wants even though it is very expensive. However, do not become a person like silk. It is nice while it is new, but when it gets a little old nothing can be done with it.\"\"Now, when it comes to cotton, it is ordinary but is used by everyone. There is nothing that is so handy nor so widely used as cotton. It keeps us warm in the winter and it absorbs our perspiration in the summer. When it becomes dirty, it can be washed over and over again. When its color fades and it becomes so old that it cannot be worn any more, it can be used as a diaper or as a cleaning rag or even as sandals. To be useful until its original form no longer remains: this is cotton. God desires man to have a mind like cotton.\"\"It is said that thereafter Ichibei and his wife carved the word \"\"cotton\"\" in their minds and wore nothing but cotton throughout their lives.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 20-21',20,NULL),(27,27,'27. Happy Day','\"On the morning of the tenth day of Oyasama?s visit to the Matsuo residence in July 1872, Ichibei and his wife went to Oyasama\'s room to extend their greetings. Oyasama asked:\"\"Would you like to have God enshrined?\"\"Ichibei replied, \"\"Yes, I would like to have God enshrined, but where would be the best place?\"\"\"\"Over there,\"\"Oyasama said, pointing Her finger to where the Buddhist altar was. It was so unexpected, like a bolt out of the blue, that Ichibei and his wife were speechless, thinking of their ancestors enshrined in the Buddhist altar. The couple exchanged glances and silently nodded their heads in approval. Ichibei asked, \"\"Then where shall the Buddhist altar be moved?\"\" Oyasama said:\"\"The ancestors will not be angry, nor will they oppose the move. Set it in a similar place in the other room.\"\"The other room was the old guest room. A carpenter was called at once to draw up plans for God\'s altar in accordance with Oyasama\'s directions. Preparations were made for the relocation of the Buddhist altar. The Buddhist priest was strongly opposed to their proposal, but they asked him to offer the prayer against his will. The relocation of the altar was completed that night without trouble. The following morning four carpenters came to build God\'s altar.\"\"If you do not hurry you will not finish in time,\"\"Oyasama said to speed up the work. It was completed on the evening of the twelfth day of Her stay. The next morning, the couple went to Oyasama\'s room to extend their greetings, but She was not there. When they went to the other room, they found Her sitting silently before the newly completed altar.\"\"You did well. This will be fine, this will be fine,\"\"Oyasama said, and then She went to the sickroom of their eldest son, Narazo, who was unable to move from his bed. As Oyasama sat beside him, She said:\"\"Your head must itch.\"\"She took Her own comb and began to comb Narazo\'s hair slowly. Oyasama said as She returned to Her room:\"\"Today is a nice day, a happy day, because today God is to be enshrined,\"\"and She smiled happily. The couple was wondering how the enshrinement was going to be done when they heard someone at the front door. Haru went to greet the visitor and it was Shuji, Oyasama\'s son. As soon as Shuji was escorted to Her room, Oyasama said:\"\"Arrangements for the enshrinement are complete, so please make the gohei, the sacred staff.\"\"When it was completed, Oyasama personally took the staff to the altar and offered Her prayers to sanctify it.\"\"God is going to be here also from today. How happy! This is truly wonderful,\"\"Oyasama said, overjoyed.\"\"I am returning home now,\"\"She said, and She returned to the Residence.The Buddhist altar was completely removed from the home at a later date.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 21-23',21,NULL),(28,28,'28. Clear the Path from the Bottom','\"Thinking of the future of the path, Chushichi Yamanaka said to Oyasama one day, \"\"The path will become so much better if it is cleared in the high mountains.\"\" Whereupon Oyasama taught:\"\"If the path is cleared from up above, can the people down below get near? If the path is cleared from down below both the people up above and the people down below can easily get near, can they not?\"\"\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 23',23,NULL),(29,29,'29. Three Treasures','\"Once Oyasama said to Izo Iburi:\"\"Izo, open your hand.\"\"She had three unhulled grains of rice in Her hand, and when Izo opened his hand as requested, Oyasama said:\"\"This is early rising, this is honesty and this is work,\"\"and placed them one at a time in the palm of his hand. Then, She continued:\"\"Hold these three firmly in your hand. You must try not to lose them.\"\"Izo adhered to this teaching for the rest of his life.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 24',24,NULL),(30,30,'30. Ten Thousandfold','\"Once Oyasama took a grain of unhulled rice in Her hand, and showed it to Izo Iburi, saying:\"\"The same is true with a human being. You sow a grain of sincerity, and it multiplies to two or three hundred grains in a year, ten thousand in the second year. Ten thousandfold, as we call it. It will be enough for sowing all over the province of Yamato in the third year.\"\"\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 24',24,NULL),(31,31,'31. The Measure of Heaven','\"One day Oyasama said to Izo Iburi:\"\"Izo, will you cut down a tree in the mountains and make a straight post from it?\"\"Izo promptly did so. Afterward, Oyasama said:\"\"Izo, try to place a ruler against the post,\"\"and She continued:\"\"Isn\'t there a gap between the two?\"\"When Izo placed the ruler against the post there was in fact a gap. So he replied, \"\"There is a little gap.\"\" Then, Oyasama taught:\"\"Exactly! Even the things that are considered to be straight by all the people of the world are warped when they are placed against the measure of heaven.\"\"\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 24-25',24,NULL),(32,32,'32. It Depends on the Wife\'s Word','\"When she was in her teens, Yasu, daughter of Rihei Matsuda of Kosaka Village in Yamato, helped cook for Oyasama for several years. Oyasama said:\"\"When a meal you have cooked is brought in, my heart seems to open up,\"\"and She enjoyed Yasu\'s cooking. Her meal consisted of rice gruel with a few soybeans. When it was not busy, there were times when Yasu was alone with Oyasama. During these times, Oyasama taught Yasu many things. On one such occasion, Oyasama taught her:\"\"Dear Yasu, a man, any man, is what a wife\'s word makes him. Even if he is a man who is apt to be called a fool by others, if his wife treats him with respect and says politely, \'Welcome home, dear,\' when he comes home, people will say, \'Although we call him a fool, judging by the respectful way his wife treats him, he must be a great man.\' Whether the husband becomes a great man or a fool depends on the wife\'s word.\"\"When Yasu was twenty-three, Oyasama arranged a marriage for her into the Inui family of Shoyashiki Village. The meeting of the prospective bride and groom was held in Oyasama\'s room. At that time, Oyasama said:\"\"God says, \'This person and that person.\' In this way, the matter is settled. After it is settled, do not sever it. If it is severed, the one who severs it will be severed.\"\"Then She moved Her handsthree times, saying:\"\"Good, good, very good.\"\"\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 25-26',25,NULL),(33,33,'33. The Bridge Between Countries','\"Risaburo Yamamoto of Kashiwara Village, Kawachi Province, injured his chest in a village sumo-wrestling match in the autumn of 1870 at the age of twenty-one. For three years from that time he was sick in bed. Doctors were consulted and prayers were offered here and there at shrines and temples for his recovery. But it was to no avail. In fact, his condition became worse until he was on the verge of death. Just at that time, during the summer of 1873, his family heard of God the Parent from a sawyer named Kuma. He had come from Furu, Yamato Province, to work at the To Sawmill in that same village of Kashiwara. Upon hearing of God the Parent, Rihachi, Risaburo\'s father, promptly returned to Jiba in place of his son. Oyasama said:\"\"This Residence is the Residence where mankind was first created. This is the birthplace of man. No matter how serious, any sickness will be cured. Bring your son here at once. I have been eagerly waiting for your coming.\"\"Receiving such encouraging words, Rihachi returned home and conveyed them to his son. Whereupon Risaburo began to say, \"\"I want to go and worship the god in Yamato.\"\" The family members tried to stop him by saying, \"\"You will never make it to Yamato.\"\" But Risaburo pleaded, \"\"I don\'t care, I still want to go. I want to be near that god.\"\"In response to his earnest pleas, a stretcher was prepared. When it became dark, he was quietly carried out of the gate. However, on the way, when they came to a big bridge over the Tatsuta River, Risaburo stopped breathing, and so they turned back. But when they reached home, he miraculously started to breathe again. Because he pleaded, \"\"I don\'t care if I die,\"\" the family, according to custom, drank water from a sake cup at what might be a final parting. Carrying him on the stretcher, they again departed for Yamato late at night with lanterns. It was a dark night.The group finally reached Jiba on the evening of the following day. The gates of the Residence were already closed, so they sought lodging in a nearby home. The next morning, Risaburo, who was on the verge of death, was brought before Oyasama. She said:\"\"You need not worry. You shall be saved for sure if you decide to dedicate your whole life to serve this Residence.\"\"Continuing, She gave him the following words:\"\"The bridge between countries; a rough log bridge. Without a bridge, a river cannot be crossed. Will you dedicate your life, or not? Arakitoryo, arakitoryo!*\"\"Oyasama ordered a bath for Risaburo, and said:\"\"Take a bath now.\"\"When he returned from the bath, Oyasama said:\"\"You must now feel fresh and lively.\"\"Although he had been in no condition to take the bath, he had no trouble doing so. In fact, Risaburo\'s suffering disappeared and his pain faded away. He heartily ate three bowls of the rice gruel that Oyasama gave him. Due to Oyasama\'s warm parental love, Risaburo received God\'s blessing and regained his health on the sixth day. After staying a month he returned to Kashiwara. The villagers were struck with admiration when they saw his vigorous health. *Arakitoryo: literally, \'the master wood cutter\'; it has the meaning of \'pioneer missionary.\'\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 26-28',26,NULL),(34,34,'34.

Have your wife take one portion after you get home, another when her labor begins, and the third one right after delivery.If you do as I tell you, your wife will not need a leaning post, special dietary restrictions or an obstetrical binder. Let her use a pillow, and do as usual. Do not worry even a little. You must not worry. Never doubt. This place is the Residence where human beings were first created. This is the parental home.

The Red Garments','\"It was on December 26, 1874, that Oyasama wore red garments for the first time. Oyasama had suddenly said:\"\"I will wear red garments.\"\"Then Matsue and daughter Kokan set out to Nara in the morning to buy cloth, and came back toward noon. When they returned, Naragiku Nishio (renamed Osame Masui), Masu Masui (renamed Suma Murata), Kaji Nakata and other women were doing chores in the Residence. Since Oyasama had said:\"\"I will wear them as soon as they are ready,\"\"they all helped, sewing in haste, and the red garments were completed by evening. Oyasama wore them for the first time that night. It is said that Oyasama, dressed in the red garments, sat on the dais; and the people in attendance enjoyed sweet rice wine in celebration of the occasion.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 28-29',28,NULL),(36,36,'36. Firm Resolution','\"On the morning of December 4, 1874, as Rin Masui tried to get up, she strangely felt pain. Both of her eyes had become badly swollen. They grew worse each day. When the consulting doctor diagnosed it as glaucoma, she became frightened. She received medical treatment, but finally lost her eyesight. This happened two years after her husband passed away.The whole family was overcome with grief. During the year-end and New Year\'s season, twelve-year-old Ikutaro, the elder child, heard the news of a god from a fellow traveler at Tatsuta. The traveler said, \"\"The god \'Tenryu-san\' at Shoyashiki in Yamato will save anyone from any sickness. One has only to offer prayers for three days and three nights.\"\" Upon Ikutaro\'s return, the parent and child promptly began praying for three days and three nights, facing toward Yamato, but there was no sign of improvement. So they sent a man-servant, Tamehachi, to Shoyashiki to pray for the family. He left Ogata early in the morning, and arrived at the Residence before noon. Tamehachi saw Oyasama, who was wearing the red garments, and he prayed to Her. He listened to the teachings from the intermediaries and asked to have the main points of the teachings written down on paper to take home.As Ikutaro read aloud to Rin the notes that Tamehachi had brought home, Rin said, \"\"Since we have thus received God\'s teachings, I don\'t care what happens to my physical body. For the sake of eliminating the family innen I will engage in the work of single-hearted salvation, not minding the severe cold and heat, and even if I have to walk with the aid of two canes. We three, mother and children, will follow the path with joy, even through fire and water.\"\" This was the firm resolution of the whole family.Not only Rin, but Ikutaro as well as eight-year-old Tomie poured cold water over themselves as a form of ascetic ritual. The whole family joined in a three-day and three-night prayer. Facing Jiba, they chanted, \"\"Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto,\"\" over and over, and prayed earnestly.The dawn of the third day came. Rin had been sitting before the brazier throughout the prayer, and Tomie, who was sitting beside her mother, noticed a ray of light through a slight opening in the door. She said, without thinking, \"\"Mother, it\'s daybreak.\"\"Hearing her daughter\'s voice, Rin turned toward the front door. She saw a gleam of light through a slight opening in the door. Thinking that it might be a dream, she quickly stood up, rushed to the front entrance and rolled open the sliding door. Outside it was glittering with morning sunlight, just as it had been years before. She had received a wonderful blessing and had recovered her eyesight completely.Rin returned at once to Jiba to offer her thanks. She thanked Oyasama through the intermediary, Gisaburo Nakata. Oyasama said:\"\"Sah, sah, you lost your eyesight during one night. Sah, sah, it is an innen, innen. God has drawn you to this Residence. Welcome, welcome home. Sayemon,* please explain the teachings in detail to her. Please explain to her.\"\"Rin stayed over that night. The next day she heard the teachings from Nakata. While she was learning the hand movements for the morning and evening service, she received Oyasama\'s words:\"\"Sah, sah, your soul has an innen. When it is the divine will to use a person in God\'s service, God will draw that person to this Residence by any means. Be thankful and follow the path joyfully, no matter what you may encounter. Persons who are destined to be used as instruments in God\'s service will be drawn to this Residence even by means of physical pain. Because I must draw you even by means of giving you suffering, what I do is different depending on the person. It is natural that there is difference. Because of My intent, you never got any better. It was only natural that you never got any better because I do things differently. Your eyesight never improved. Sah, sah, it is an innen, innen. Sayemon, please explain in detail. You could not see because it was as if God\'s hands were in front of your eyes. Sah, she says she cannot see ahead. When the hands are removed you can see at once. You can see, can\'t you? Sah, sah, take heart, take heart. You will not have any hardships, even if you wish to undergo hardships. It is all up to the individual\'s mind.\"\"Rin stayed over again that night. The next morning, she asked Nakata to tell Oyasama that she was returning to Kawachi, and she again received Oyasama\'s words:\"\"You just heard a bit of the teachings and you have returned from a far place, passing through mountain trails and valleys. Sah, sah, I accept your firm resolution. Look ahead with joy, with joy. Sah, sah, I will provide you with clothing, food, and spending money. Remember you are to serve God for a long time. Sah, sah, look ahead, look ahead, look ahead with joy.\"\"Rin was speechless and was moved to tears. Rin Masui was then thirty-two years of age. * Gisaburo Nakata was the former Sayemon Nakata. In or about 1873, due to the Japanese government\'s edict abolishing names ending in \"\"-suke,\"\" and \"\"-yemon,\"\" \"\"Sayemon\"\" was changed to \"\"Gisaburo.\"\"\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 29-32',29,NULL),(37,37,'37. You Are Faithful in Your Work','\"One day in 1874, Naragiku Nishio returned to the Residence and was sitting in front of Oyasama with other people. When they were preparing to leave, Oyasama called the name of Kokan, Her daughter, and asked:\"\"Dear daughter, isn\'t there anything to do? These people will not leave if they are asked to do something. There is something, isn\'t there?\"\"To this question, Kokan answered, \"\"Yes, there are many things to do, but I was hesitating to ask them.\"\" Then Oyasama said:\"\"Why not ask them?\"\"Kokan asked them to spin yarn. They worked hard at spinning and winding yarn on the spindle. Soon Naragiku, who was then eighteen, completed one spindle. Oyasama went to her and tapped her on the shoulder. She raised the spindle to Her head three times and said:\"\"Dear Naragiku, girls of your age yearn for many things. You are so young, yet faithful in your work, I admire you. There are a lot of things to do in this Residence if you are of the mind to work. While working in this Residence, you will not be able to leave, even if you want to. I recommend that you work as hard as possible when you can. Then, in the future you will be quite free from hardship, even if you want it.

Gisaburo Nakata came from the Residence at once to save the child and Narazo was marvelously saved. Father and son then visited the Residence immediately to express their gratitude. From that time on, Yahei was a fervent believer.One day, after coming home from the Residence, Yahei went to bed late. Around midnight, he heard a noise under the floor. Thinking, \"\"This is strange!\"\" he quietly got up and looked around the house. With an exclamation of surprise, a man ran away into the dark. He left behind a large bundle of various precious items taken from Yahei\'s home.Yahei was very happy. The next morning he promptly visited the Residence and thanked Oyasama from the bottom of his heart, saying, \"\"Because of your blessing, it turned out very well for me.

He spent all that day at the Residence and went back to Higai Village that night.However, when he returned home, he began to feel pain in his arm again. He waited impatiently for daybreak and returned to the Residence. Then, incredibly, the pain in his arm stopped.These same events occurred repeatedly and during three years he returned to the Residence almost every day. Toward the end of this period, Oyasama said gently:\"\"Yonosuke, stay here.\"\"And so, in accord with Her words, he stayed at the Residence and helped with the work there.

His purpose was to pray that his daughter Kiyo be cured of insanity. From the old woman of a teahouse he happened to hear that a living god resided in Shoyashiki Village. He then hurried to Shoyashiki through Miwa and visited the Residence. He asked an intermediary for an audience with Oyasama, who told him:\"\"You need not worry. Never! Go home quickly, as something wrong has happened in your home. Visit houses in your village one by one and save forty-two persons.

Then as Oyasama had instructed him, he visited every house in his village, spreading the fragrance of the teachings of God. He visited the homes of the sick repeatedly, praying for the healing of forty-two people.Wonderfully, his daughter was completely cured. Also, people came from many homes to express their gratitude. Restored to sanity, his daughter married a man adopted into her family.

On the day of the funeral service, they came and helped from early morning.On the following day, during the after-funeral dinner, they talked about their memories of Kokan, and recalled Oyasama\'s words. In the course of their talk, one of them tearfully said, \"\"Indeed, we have been doubtful of God until now and have no word to excuse ourselves.\"\"On hearing this, one of the seniors who worked at the Residence suggested, \"\"Why don\'t you form a fraternity?\"\" Whereupon, the villagers talked, and agreed among themselves to form their own fraternity. When this was reported to Oyasama, She was very pleased.Then they had to name the fraternity, but at first the farmers could not think of a good idea. In the meantime, someone suggested, \"\"Since this is the place of origin where God resides, how about naming it Tengen(divine locale)-ko?\"\" Everyone agreed to this name, and they inquired of Oyasama about it. She said:\"\"That will do.\"\"And She took off Her red formal coat and gave it to them, saying:\"\"This shall be enshrined as the symbol of faith.\"\"In this way the Tengen-ko Fraternity was born.

She was crossing Taka Bridge of Nukatabe. The bridge at that time was less than one meter wide and there was no railing on it. She was afraid that she might fall so she crawled barefoot on the snow-covered bridge.She had struggled along to the middle, when a sudden blast of wind struck her, causing her to sway dangerously, almost falling off the bridge. This happened many times. Each time she clung to the bridge, pressed against the snow, and crawled like an ant, praying earnestly, \"\"Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto, Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto.\"\" She was just barely able to cross the bridge. Then, going through Miyando and Nikaido, she arrived at the Residence around four o\'clock in the afternoon. When she slid open the door and entered the Place for the Service, Iye Murata told her, \"\"Just this moment Oyasama was looking out of the window, and said:\'Well, well. Someone is coming on this stormy day. How sincere she is! She must be having a hard time of it.\' \"\"Rin was overjoyed with her safe return to the Residence, saying, \"\"Ah, thank God!\"\" Her hands and feet were numb after walking about thirty kilometers from Kawachi to the Residence in the snowstorm. Those people who happened to be there helped her take off her traveling attire, took good care of her in many ways and warmed her with three braziers until warmth returned to her body. Then she went into the presence of Oyasama to pay her respects, and Oyasama said to her:\"\"Oh, I am so glad to see you have come. God the Parent lent a hand to bring you home. You had a hard time, slipping at many places. However, you were joyful. Sah, sah, God the Parent accepts fully, fully. Whatever you ask, it is accepted. God protects you. Enjoy it, enjoy it, enjoy it!\"\"So saying, Oyasama grasped Rin\'s cold hands with both Her own. It was something more than warming them over the brazier. Rin was moved with gratitude and awe at the inexpressible warmth of Oyasama.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 38-39',38,NULL),(45,45,'45. Wrinkles of the Mind','\"Oyasama did not waste one sheet of paper, not even an old scrap of paper. She carefully smoothed the wrinkles even out of the paper that had been used as gift wrappings and placed them under Her cushion to be used again. Oyasama taught:\"\"If wrinkled paper is left as it is, it can be used only as toilet paper or as paper to blow one\'s nose, but if its wrinkles are carefully smoothed out, it can be used in many ways. Once it is used as toilet paper or paper to blow one\'s nose it cannot be retrieved and used again.The saving of a man also follows this principle. It is to smooth the wrinkles of man\'s mind with the truth of the teachings. When the mind becomes completely wrinkled, it becomes like the toilet paper. Saving such minds, rather than discarding them, is the principle of this path.\"\"Once when Rin Masui came to see Oyasama and asked for permission to copy the Ofudesaki, Oyasama said:\"\"Do you have any paper?\"\"When Rin answered, \"\"I will go to Tambaichi and buy some,\"\" Oyasama said:\"\"It will be late if you do so. Let Me bind some for you.\"\"She then took some sheets of paper out from under Her cushion and disregarding the difference in their sizes, She selected those that had no writing on them, and bound them Herself. Then saying:\"\"Sah, I will read it to you. Write it on this,\"\"Oyasama read the Ofudesaki. Rin picked up the writing brush and wrote. It was a copy of Part IV of the Ofudesaki, and to this day it is preserved as it was originally bound, with the paper irregular in size.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 39-40',39,NULL),(46,46,'46. Everything from This to That','\"One day a follower brought a large fish for an offering. After the fish was offered, Shuji asked Rin Masui to prepare it. Rin looked for a carving knife but could not find one. Then Shuji said, \"\"Orin, is it a carving knife you are looking for? There is a large vegetable knife in the kitchen. Use that to prepare the fish.\"\" There was no carving knife.Rin thought, \"\"How inconvenient,\"\" and one day asked to have the day off, and returned to Kawachi. As that day happened to be the day of Otaiya at Yao,* she immediately went to Yao and bought a carving knife, a thin fish-slicer, a pair of scissors, and other useful household items. She returned to the Residence and presented them as a gift from her. Shuji and Matsue were so delighted with the presents that Shuji said, \"\"Such nice things! I want to show them to Grandmother.** Come along with us,\"\" he urged. When they met Oyasama, Rin first thanked Her for the day off. Oyasama accepted the presents and said:\"\"Orin, you have given thought to everything from this to that. Oh, I am grateful. Oyasama was very pleased.\"\"It is said that Rin, overwhelmed with the graciousness of Oyasama, bowed, pressing her forehead against the tatami-mat and shed tears of gratitude. * Otaiya at Yao refers to a string of roadside stands which open between the Temple of Yao and the Temple of Kyuhoji on the eleventh and twenty-seventh of each month.  ** Oyasama. \"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 40-41',40,NULL),(47,47,'47. Be Joyful of the Future','\"On the evening of June 18, 1876, Gisaburo Nakata said, \"\"Oyasama often says:\'The pine tree may die, but do not worry.\'We were wondering which pine tree She meant.\"\" Rin Masui then told of the prevailing superstitions among the people: \"\"A pine tree that has been exorcised will die. The pine tree in the Masui residence has been exorcised, so the pine tree will die and the family is doomed. It will die out. This is what the people are saying.\"\" Hearing this, Nakata immediately went and asked Oyasama the meaning of this talk about pine trees. Oyasama said:\"\"Sah, sah, do you understand? Do you understand? Although you cannot see anything today, be joyful of the future. Be joyful! The pine tree may die, but do not worry. No matter what people say, no matter what people may say, do not pay any attention to what people say.\"\"A few moments later, Oyasama added:\"\"The pine tree in the residence, the pine tree may die, but do not worry. There is joy in the future. That residence is to become an uchiwake-basho, a place of salvation.\"\"\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 41',41,NULL),(48,48,'48. Waiting, Waiting','\"Around two o\'clock in the afternoon of November 9, 1876, Kajiro Ueda was leaving for the Tenjin Festival at Kayo. Suddenly his daughter Naraito, who was weaving, began to cry, \"\"Iwagami-san of Furu with his great mass of hair is descending on me. I\'m frightened.\"\" Later, she was administered all possible medical treatment without success. Through the devoted efforts of Yahei Nishiura, a neighbor, the Ueda family entered the faith and Naraito gradually recovered. She returned to Jiba the following month and was received by Oyasama who graciously said to her:\"\"I have been waiting, waiting. You were My aunt who saved Me five generations ago.\"\"She was completely cured in three days. Naraito was then fourteen years old.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 42',42,NULL),(49,49,'49. Obedient Mind','\"In 1876 or 1877, when he was five or six years old, Yoshimatsu Hayashi dislocated his right wrist. So his grandmother took him to the Residence.\"\"Welcome home, dear,\"\"said Oyasama. Then, pointing to the tea cup at the entrance, She said:\"\"Please bring Me that tea cup.\"\"Yoshimatsu was going to lift it up with his left hand as his right one hurt.\"\"No, dear boy, this hand, this hand,\"\"said Oyasama, raising Her right hand. Because Her voice was so august, the obedient boy dared not disobey. Much to his amazement, he was able to hold the cup. Before he realized it, he had been saved, and his right hand was healed.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 42-43',42,NULL),(50,50,'50. Kosuke and Suma','\"Kiku Masui took her daughter, Masu (who later became Suma Murata) to visit Kiku\'s parents for three days in March 1877 for the rendo* and returned home on the twentieth.Masu was unable to get up the next morning because of a severe headache. Her mother scolded her in her effort to train her properly, so she finally got up. She still didn\'t feel well the following morning, the twenty-second. So Masu wanted to return to the Residence. After receiving permission, she left her home in Izushichijo Village at eight o\'clock in the morning, and reached the Residence at about ten o\'clock. When Oyasama saw her, She said:\"\"Are you willing to marry into the Murata family in Senzai?\"\"Although this was totally unexpected, Masu answered Oyasama\'s words with, \"\"Yes, thank you.\"\" Then Oyasama said:\"\"It is not good for you to decide by yourself. I would like to have your elder brother (Isaburo Masui) come.\"\"So Masu returned to her home in Izushichijo Village on the same day and told her brother about the proposal. By that time her headache had disappeared completely.As this was God\'s request, Isaburo decided to comply early the next morning. So he returned to the Residence on the morning of the following day, the twenty-third, and was received by Oyasama, who said:\"\"Will you give Omasu in marriage to Murata? If you agree, please come here together with Omasu on the twenty-sixth.\"\"Isaburo gratefully said, \"\"Thank you very much,\"\" and returned to Izushichijo Village.When Iye Murata of Senzai returned to the Residence the next day, the twenty-fourth, Oyasama questioned her:\"\"Oiye, I have been waiting for your arrival. I wish to offer your family a bride. Do you want a bride for your son?\"\"Iye replied, \"\"Thank you very much.\"\" Then Oyasama told her:\"\"The Masui family will be here on the twenty-sixth with their daughter, so take her home.\"\"On the morning of the twenty-sixth, four members of the Masui family returned to the Residence. They were mother Kiku, elder brother and his wife, and Masu. They brought several dishes of dainty foods that were prepared and packed in a nest of boxes.From Senzai, Kamematsu (who was twenty-six years old at that time) and his parents, Koyemon and Iye, his wife, returned to the Residence with sweet rice wine and several dishes in a nest of boxes.In Oyasama\'s room in the Nakaminami-Gatehouse, Oyasama first sipped the sweet rice wine, and then Kamematsu and Masu shared the rest of it from the same cup.\"\"You are going to Senzai only for a short while. You are to return here soon,\"\"Oyasama told Masu.As Masu received the name \"\"Suma\"\" from Oyasama at that time, she was so renamed. Later, in 1879, Kamematsu received the name \"\"Kosuke\"\" from Oyasama and was thus also renamed. * Rendo, also called renzo, is the farmers\' spring holiday. Although it was not observed on the same day in each village, the farmers made rice cakes and dumplings, and rested just before the busy season of planting and weeding.

Family Treasure','\"One day in June or July 1877, Iye Murata was serving as Oyasama\'s attendant as usual, when Oyasama unexpectedly handed her a piece of red cloth prepared for a vest and said:\"\"Oiye, please sew this.\"\"Iye wondered why Oyasama told her to do the sewing, but before long, she finished the work and Oyasama at once put on the newly tailored vest.On the evening of that day, Iye\'s son, Kamematsu, returned to Jiba to worship at the Residence because of severe pain in his arm.When told of his return, Oyasama said:\"\"Oh, really?\"\"and soon after, She went to bed. After a while, She sat up and said:\"\"Call Kamematsu here if he still has pain in his arm.\"\"When he came before Her, Oyasama said:\"\"Sah, sah, do not wear this out. It shall be your family treasure. Whenever occasions require, put it on and pray.\"\"So saying, She took off the red vest and personally helped him put it on. She further instructed him:\"\"Keep it on and go to the Kanrodai at once to perform the service of Ashiki harai, tasuke tamae, ichiretsu sumasu Kanrodai.\"\"\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 45',45,NULL),(52,52,'52.

He reflected on his condition and realized that he should have his daughter learn to play the koto. So he made up his mind and went to Koriyama to buy a koto.While he was talking with the shopkeeper at the music shop, the boil on his right arm burst and the pain stopped completely. He realized that this indeed had been God\'s intention. Carrying a big koto on his shoulder with the arm which had hurt until shortly before, he went home in high spirits. * Koto: a thirteen-stringed long zither which is plucked with picks.

From This Residence ','\"One day in 1877, when Yoshie Iburi was twelve years old, her fingertips ached unbearably. She asked Oyasama what to do. Oyasama said to her:\"\"Learn to play the shamisen.*\"\"She decided to learn at once. However, in those days at Takashina in Ichinomoto there was no place to learn the shamisen. So she asked Oyasama, \"\"Shall I go to Koriyama or some other place to learn?\"\" Oyasama said to her:\"\"I am not sending you anywhere to learn, or inviting anyone to teach you. All things are to be learned in this Residence. There is nothing that can be learned from the world. Because it is first taught from this Residence, there is truth in what is learned.\"\"Oyasama personally taught her how to play the shamisen. This was to become the shamisen part for the Service. * Shamisen: a three-stringed instrument similar to a lute which is plucked with a plectrum.Note: Yoshie Iburi was married in 1888.

Play It with All Your Heart','\"Yoshie Iburi had been learning the shamisen from Oyasama Herself since 1877, when Yoshie was twelve. During the three years of learning, Yoshie was also given instructions in spiritual attitude. Oyasama taught:\"\"You must get all the instruments at any cost.\"\"Even if you have not practiced enough, be seated in front of the instrument and play it with all your heart. God will accept your heart.\"\"Dear Yoshie, pluck \'position three\' and \'position two\' in succession. It makes a tune for hito-o-tsu.* In this way, practice the shamisen.\"\" * Hitotsu: literally, \'one.\' This word begins the first verse of eleven of the twelve chapters of the Sacred Songs for the Service.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 47',47,NULL),(55,55,'55.

Her father and elder brother tried hard to hold her still but their efforts were in vain. Instead, their bodies also began to sway as they tried to stop her. So Naraito\'s father took her to the Residence and inquired of Oyasama about it. Oyasama said:\"\"Kokyu, kokyu.\"\"The moment Naraito answered, \"\"Yes,\"\" her swaying stopped.In this way, Naraito started to take lessons on the kokyu from Oyasama and subsequently took part in the Service. * Kokyu: a three-stringed instrument played with a bow in a vertical position.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 47-48',47,NULL),(56,56,'56. Thank You for Your Trouble Last Night','\"One time, while Sadahiko Izutsu was on duty at the Main Sanctuary, he said to Tsuchisaburo Itakura, \"\"You have undergone hardships many times in police stations and jails. It\'s a wonder that you were able to continue in your faith under such circumstances.\"\" Tsuchisaburo Itakura replied, \"\"During my third visit to the Residence three police officers came and threw us into the Tambaichi Branch Jail. That whole night we discussed the idea of quitting the faith. However, I thought I would wait until I could see Oyasama one more time. So I returned to the Residence. When Oyasama saw me, She smiled and said compassionately:\'Thank you for your trouble last night.\'Just these few words of Oyasama made me resolve to undergo any hardship any number of times.\"\"This is the story Izutsu heard from Tsuchisaburo Itakura in 1931 or 1932, when the Main Sanctuary consisted only of the North Worship Hall.

A Boy Should Be Accompanied by His Father','\"In the summer of 1877, nine-year-old Narazo Yaoi of Izushichijo Village, Yamato Province, was playing with two or three neighborhood children in the Saho River that flowed on the west side of the village. Somehow his penis was bitten by a leech. It did not hurt much at the time, but two or three days later it became swollen. Although there was no pain, his parents were worried because it was such an important organ. Doctors were consulted, faith healing was tried and the best of care was given, but there was no sign of recovery.Jirokichi Kita\'s aunt, Ko Yaoi, of the same village, and Isaburo Masui\'s mother, Kiku, were already devout followers at that time. So they urged Narazo\'s grandmother, Koto, to join the faith. Being religious by nature, she readily agreed. But Narazo\'s father, Sogoro, was only interested in farming and he laughed at those who were religious. Koto asked him, \"\"Do you wish to cancel my sixtieth birthday celebration or do you wish to join the faith?* Please choose one or the other.\"\" So Sogoro finally consented to join. It was January 1878.Then grandmother Koto took Narazo to Jiba at once. They were received by Oyasama, who was shown his ailment. Oyasama gave them the following words:\"\"The pillar of the family. This is a trouble of the pillar. You will be saved according to your mind.\"\"From then on grandmother Koto and Narazo\'s mother, Naka, took turns returning with him to the Residence, a distance of about six kilometers, every third day. But there was no sign of any blessing.In the middle of March 1878, while Koto was visiting the Residence with Narazo, Chusaku Tsuji told them, \"\"We are told that \'a boy should be accompanied by his father.\' Please have Sogoro himself return here accompanying his own son.\"\" Whereupon Koto returned home and asked Sogoro, \"\"Won\'t you please return to the Residence?\"\"So Sogoro returned to Jiba, accompanying Narazo, on March 25th and returned home that same evening. However, Narazo\'s penis became swollen the following morning, just as it did when it was first bitten. But on the morning of the twenty-eighth he received the blessing of a complete cure. The whole family was happy beyond description. Narazo, then a boy of ten years, was thrilled from the bottom of his heart to have received the providence of God the Parent. This became the foundation of his devout faith for the rest of his life. * In Japan, the sixtieth birthday is a very auspicious event. It is customary for the children to provide the celebration for their parent, and the parent would lose face in the community if he was not celebrated.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 49-50',49,NULL),(58,58,'58. Today from Kawachi','\"The following incident took place in about 1877. Chozo Yamada of Kawachi Province, then twenty years old, had been confined to bed for several years, suffering from illness.One day, a tradesman who came to buy cotton told him that there was a wondrous god at Shoyashiki in Yamato. Unable to move, Chozo single-heartedly prayed to the god from his sickbed. Much to his surprise, he gradually began to feel better. He would pray gratefully even when he drank water and this made him feel even better. Within several days, he was able to get out of bed.Chozo, deeply moved by God\'s wondrous providence, made up his mind to visit Shoyashiki to give thanks to the living god. His family thought that in his condition it was still too early to do so and opposed the plans. He insisted, however, and set out on his pilgrimage on crutches, accompanied by his brother, Yosakichi. As they reached Minamikashiwara, about four kilometers away from his home in Osakabe Village, he found himself able to walk with a single crutch. When they reached Tatsuta in Yamato Province, he was able to walk without using any crutches. He then let his brother go home, and continued his journey to the Residence alone.An intermediary told him, \"\"You came from Kawachi, didn\'t you? This morning, God said,\'Today there will be a visitor from Kawachi.\'That must be you. God has been waiting for you.\"\" Chozo was astonished and thought that this was indeed the place where the living god resided.When he was granted an audience with Oyasama, She spoke to him tenderly. During his one-week stay he recovered completely. When he bade farewell to Her, She said:\"\"Come back soon, won\'t you?\"\"He went home in high spirits, singing folk songs as he crossed the Shigi Hills.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 50-51',50,NULL),(59,59,'59. Festival','\"In January 1878, when she was twenty-eight, Koiso Yamanaka (later Iye Yamada) was drawn to the Residence to serve Oyasama. Oyasama told her about the significance of the twenty-sixth day of the month:\"\"Festival (Matsuri) has the meaning \'to wait.\' (matsu: wait, ri: principle). Do not do anything else the whole day of the twenty-sixth. The only thing you must do on that day is to give thanks for the marvelous protection of God the Parent.\"\"Koiso sewed the red garments and combed Oyasama\'s hair as part of her daily routine. Usually, Oyasama prepared the red cloth Herself and handed it to Koiso.Not long after Koiso started to serve Oyasama in the Residence, on April 28, 1878 (March 26th, lunar calendar), there was still time left after sweeping and cleaning. So she said, \"\"Oyasama, it seems wasteful to be doing nothing from early morning. I wish you would give me some red cloth to sew.\"\" After thinking for a while, Oyasama said:\"\"I understand.\"\"Then, She cut the red cloth quickly and smoothly, and gave it to Koiso.Koiso was happy to have something to do, and began sewing at once. No sooner had she put a few stitches into the cloth than she was in pitch darkness even though it was daytime. In complete amazement, Koiso cried out, \"\"Oyasama,\"\" and said to herself, \"\"Now, I understand. It was against the divine will to think it was wasting time. I will sew the red garment tomorrow.\"\" The moment she made up her mind, it became daylight again, and everything was all right with her.Later, when she told Oyasama what had happened, Oyasama instructed:\"\"I cut the red cloth because you, Koiso, said it was wasting time to be doing nothing from morning. If you sweep and mop, you need not do anything else on the twenty-sixth day except perform the Service. You must not.\"\"\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 51-52',51,NULL),(60,60,'60.

The truth of the reason for the three pieces in a packet is the beginning of being nourished. The second packet is the truth of firm protection. The third packet is the truth that after being fully nourished, sufferings disappear. is the truth of the providences coming forth. Three fives is fifteen; therefore, it is the truth of the sufficiency of the providences coming forth. The seventh packet is the truth of nothing to worry about. Three sevens is twenty one; therefore, it is the truth of fully settled peace. The ninth packet is the truth of the disappearance of sufferings. Three nines is twenty seven; therefore, it is the truth of nothing at all to worry about.\"\" * Small sugar candies (kompeito) were one of the substances which Oyasama used for the Grant for Safe Childbirth.

With the shout of \'one, two, three,\' they tightly gripped each other\'s hands and began to pull. Tamizo pulled with all his might but Oyasama did not move even an inch. Tamizo marveled at Oyasama\'s strength.On another occasion, Oyasama spoke the following words when Tamizo came to visit Her:\"\"Tamizo, you are returning from Onishi now but in the future you will come together with Onaka to this Residence to live.\"\"Tamizo thought, \"\"I am a farmer and I have children. It cannot be possible for me to do such a thing.\"\" Later on, however, because of the illness of his child, he and his family were drawn to the Residence to live. Also, on another occasion, Tamizo returned to the Residence with his mother, Iso. At that time Oyasama said:\"\"Tamizo, in this Residence in the future, many people will be walking back and forth beneath the corridor.\"\"It is said that in his late years, Tamizo was truly amazed by the fact that Oyasama\'s words one after another became a reality.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 53-54',53,NULL),(62,62,'62. East from Here','\"In December 1878, Togoro, father of Toshiro Yamamoto of Kasa Village in Yamato, came down with a serious eye disease. The father\'s condition gradually grew more serious and became beyond the doctor\'s help. Even incantations proved to be ineffective. Toshiro, having no other course opened to him, was in a state of deep despair when he heard from his friend, \"\"In Shoyashiki there is a god who saves man from illness.\"\" Toshiro\'s only thought was to have his father get well at any cost. Because of weakness from the long illness and the eye disease, it was difficult for his father to walk. Therefore, Toshiro carried him on his back and walked about twelve kilometers of mountainous road. Thus he returned to Jiba for the first time.They were received by Oyasama, who spoke these words:\"\"Welcome home ! Soon he will be saved. Out of respect for your devotion to your father, he will be saved.\"\"They lodged at the house called Inada in Shoyashiki Village and stayed at Jiba for a little over a month. During that time they worshiped day and night and listened to the teachings taught by the intermediaries. The father, even with such a serious illness, received the divine providence and began to recover slowly but steadily each day, and finally recovered completely.In the summer of 1880, Toshiro\'s wife, Shyu, was cured of a stomach ailment and then Kozaburo, his second son, from convulsions; Toshiro continued to follow the faith more fervently.Also, one autumn when he returned to pray for the salvation of a sick person to whom he had taught the teachings for the first time, Oyasama said:\"\"Yamamoto from Kasa, how faithfully you always come to worship! About the illness there is no need to worry.\"\"Upon receiving these words of Oyasama he returned home and found that the sick person already had been cured.As he continued his devotion in this way, he came to know Chuzaburo Koda quite well. Koda, who admired Yamamoto\'s steadfast faith, spoke about it to Oyasama. The words of Oyasama were:\"\"East from here, at the remote village of Kasa, there shall be worshipers from all directions. Go at once.\"\"Thereupon Koda went to Kasa Village with Chusaku Tsuji and conveyed these words of Oyasama to Yamamoto. Thus Yamamoto became all the more ardent in spreading the fragrance of the word of God and saving others.\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 54-55',54,'\"Translation of \"\"Sawa\'s note[Based on] the oral account of Yamada Koei (daughter of Koiso) in 1964.\"\"\"\r'),(63,63,'63.

Oyasama said to him:\"\"These crumpled pieces, if smoothed out gently like this, become neat and can be used again. Nothing is useless.\"\"Receiving this instruction, Izumita cheerfully went back to Osaka to continue his work of saving others even more earnestly.However, it was hard to save others and spread the teachings. Accordingly, whenever his confidence was shaken, he poured water over himself to encourage himself on to further efforts. At midnight, during the coldest season of the year, he would immerse himself in the Yodo River for as long as two hours, and climbing up on the bank, he would dry himself in the wind, as he thought drying with a towel would spoil the effect. It was not so cold in the water, but the blowing north wind would severely and coldly sting his wet body. However, he patiently continued these cold water ablutions for about thirty nights.

They were stopped and threatened that they would not be allowed to go home because they had not greeted the gatekeepers. The three persons apologized and knelt down with their hands in the muddy ground, after which they were allowed to go.At the Residence, visitors were harassed by police officers on guard at the entrance. In addition, different officers would come to investigate as often as three times during a night, so that people in the Residence could sleep for only two hours or so each night.On November 9th, Oyasama was met by numerous persons when She returned to the Residence.

Then, Oyasama took out a sheet of  paper quietly and said:\"\"May I have a pair of scissors?\"\"One  of the attendants handed a pair to Her, and Oyasama cut the paper  squarely. Then She brought out about one hundred and fifty grams of  small sugar candies. She put three candies on each of the three sheets  of paper and wrapped them, saying:\"\"This  is for the Grant for Safe Childbirth. A high pillow or a binder is not  necessary.

Why don\'t you try God\'s strength today?\"\"Oyasama told an attendant to bring a hand towel and, holding its border between Her thumb and index finger, She asked Tosa:\"\"Now try and pull it.\"\"After  bowing respectfully, Tosa tried to pull it toward himself with all his  might, but he could pull it no closer. Oyasama said, smiling:\"\"Now, pull it harder. Pull with all your might. Do not hesitate.\"\"Tosa  pulled, his face reddening with the effort. However strongly he pulled it, he was unable to draw it close to himself. Tosa was a strong-armed  man by nature, and proud of the strength which he had gained as a  sailor, yet he could not draw the towel closer to himself. At last he  bowed his head and said, \"\"I am overwhelmed.\"\" Then, Oyasama stretched Her  right hand toward him and said:\"\"Try once more. Now hold Me by the wrist this time.\"\"Tosa said, \"\"Pardon me,\"\" and respectfully gripped Oyasama\'s hand. Oyasama said:\"\"Now more strongly. More strongly.\"\"The  more strongly he grasped, the more painful his hand became.

Her monthly  period is the flower. Without the flower there is no fruit. Understand  this well. Take the pumpkin; if its big flower is gone, that is the end  of it.

Observing this, Osame thought, \"\"Even Oyasama  chooses the best in selecting a persimmon.\"\" But the persimmon that She selected appeared to be the worst of the lot. She then offered the tray with the other persimmons to Osame and said:\"\"Now, please take one.\"\"Observing  Oyasama\'s actions, Osame thought, \"\"It is true that Oyasama makes Her  selection, but what She chooses is different from that which we humans  choose.

Zenzo was then thirty-one years old, and running a hosiery shop at Shiomachi Street in Semba, Osaka.Oyasama taught him with painstaking care. However,  in the beginning, since Zenzo was a newcomer who had not experienced a  marvelous cure himself, he listened to the teachings very casually while  smoking his pipe. Then, without realizing it, he had put down his pipe  and had slid forward into a deep bow. Among the words being spoken at that moment, he retained only the following:\"\"Merchants should buy dearly and sell cheaply.\"\"Zenzo could not understand its meaning at all. He  thought, \"\"If I should do business in such a manner, it would cost me my  livelihood. She may be well informed on farming, but She knows little  about business.\"\" So saying to himself, he went home.Later,  when Zenzo entered his house after leaving Imagawa, his neighbor, he  was struck with a sudden attack of vomiting and diarrhea. A doctor was sent for immediately but he was unable to remedy the situation. Umejiro Izutsu, head of the Shimmei-gumi [Confraternity], was asked to come by Imagawa. Sitting by at Zenzo\'s bedside, Izutsu asked him, \"\"Didn\'t you complain of something on your first return to Jiba?\"\" Zenzo then replied that he could not agree with what Oyasama had told him. Then  Izutsu explained, \"\"What God means is that the ideal of business is to  buy dearly in order to please wholesale dealers, sell cheaply in order  to please customers, and to be satisfied with a small profit.\"\" Upon hearing this, Zenzo could fully understand the meaning of Oyasama\'s words.

This led to an attack of rheumatism which was so painful that she kept crying for three days and three nights.She  received a doctor\'s care, and incantations were made at a nearby  place. However, the pain did not ease at all; on the contrary, it became  more severe.Then,  the teachings of God the Parent were told to Ujiro by Omitsu Matsuura  of the same village. Omitsu instructed Ujiro to offer a sacred light by  burning rapeseed oil in a small dish, and to face toward Jiba and pray,  \"\"Please stop the pain before this light burns out.\"\" Without  a moment\'s delay, he offered the sacred light and firmly resolving, \"\"If  she is saved, I will follow the path and transmit the path to my future  generations,\"\" he prayed fervently. His daughter, who had been crying  uncontrollably from the agonizing pain in her arms and legs, instantly  received a divine blessing and was healed.The  parents were so happy with this blessing that they decided to pay a  visit to thank God. Thus, Ujiro, carrying his daughter Naramume on his  back, returned to the Residence for the first time. Ujiro was received by Oyasama through the arrangement of Chusaku Tsuji. Ujiro thanked Her for saving his daughter.Soon afterward, Ujiro fell ill with tuberculosis and lost so much weight that he was a pitiful sight to see. So he returned to the Residence and was granted an audience with Oyasama. Her words were:\"\"By putting a mark on your body, I have drawn you here.\"\"He was instructed to change his clothes and come back again without delay. The next day, when he changed his clothes and returned, Oyasama bestowed on him the truth of the sazuke.His tuberculosis, which had been thought to be incurable, was soon cured.

Hyoshiro, too, on October  7th of the same year, went blind. This was divine guidance. On November  1st, Hyoshiro asked his wife Tsune to return to Jiba in his place. Oyasama said:\"\"This  eye condition is not serious. It is just that God\'s fingers are keeping  them closed. Keeping them closed means God is testing him and guiding  him.\"\"She continued:\"\"A  message sent through people is just a message. A favor asked of people  is just a favor. Words pass through one person, then there is one more  person. Words pass through two persons, then there are two more persons.  The more people words pass through, the more the words become  distorted. If distorted words are imparted, error will be committed in  the world. If an error is committed, then it is too late. It is best for  the person to return himself. Thereupon, I shall teach him well.\"\"Tsune  returned home and related these words to Hyoshiro. He was deeply  impressed and said, \"\"Indeed, that is right.\"\" On the morning of November  3rd, he traveled the distance of sixteen kilometers from Kasama and  returned to the Residence, cane in one hand and his wife guiding him by  the other. Oyasama began by saying:\"\"Sah, sah,\"\"and for two hours thereafter She taught him the story of the creation.Oyasama\'s  voice at that time was so forceful that it made the household fixtures  tremble. As soon as Oyasama had finished speaking, Hyoshiro suddenly  realized that his sight had returned without his knowing when or how.  When he came home, he found that the eldest daughter Kimi\'s eyes had  also been marvelously cured. However, thereafter for some reason until  about eight o\'clock every morning, he could not see very far, and  everything was a blur to him. No matter how much he reflected, he did  not receive God\'s blessing. Therefore, in January of the following year,  1886, he returned to Jiba again, and asked for guidance. Oyasama  instructed to him:\"\"God  has finished guiding you, but has not finished testing you. Testing  means that through saving others you yourself shall be saved. You must  not think of yourself. If you single-heartedly turn yourself to the  thought, \'I must at any cost save others and have others be saved,\' then  your illness will be completely cured.\"\"Accordingly, thereafter, he ardently strived to save others and before long he had completely recovered from his illness.Anecdotes of Oyasama pp. 134-135\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 135',135,NULL),(168,168,'168.

Our Body is of Prime Importance (mijo ga moto ya)','\"Oyasama said:\"\"Where  there is life, there is hope, it is said. The body is the foundation.  Money is secondary. In the case of fire, one would take out as many  valuables as possible, but one would not do so at the risk of burning  one\'s body. In  the case of flood, it is the same. In the case of robbery, because life  is important, one lets the robber have the money, even though one does  so reluctantly.\"\"The  same thing is true in the case of illness. One should give quickly to  charity the things that are of secondary importance, and have one\'s  illness cured.

She  had a slender figure. Her face was oval and Her mouth and chin were  identical with that of Her daughter, Omasa, although Omasa\'s face was a  little rounder.

Among these  were rice with sweet potatoes, rice with beans, rice with dried gourd  shavings, with matsutake mushrooms, and with pumpkins.If people came by chance while She was having one of these rice dishes, She would make a rice-ball and offer it to them.She was also fond of kakinoha zushi,  marinated fish and rice wrapped in persimmon leaves which are plucked  when they have a pleasant aroma after new buds have sprouted.','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 152-153',152,NULL),(195,195,'195.

There  are families with plenty of work to be done but with no one to do the  work, and there are families with plenty of people to do the work but  with no work to be done.When  apprenticed, think of all the work as your own instead of as your  master\'s, and work faithfully whether being watched or not. For  example, in the fall, if you notice that it is a cloudy day, take care  of the straw mats and any other things as though they were your own and  be sure to put them away.Because you work faithfully and help others in various ways, in the fall people will make new kimono to give to you and do other good things for you. When it reaches this stage it will be advantageous for both. If  you are going to do work, do it as faithfully as you would do your own,  whether being watched or not. Then people will say, \'That person is  considerate, so I will hire him.\' When you become such a person, there  will be plenty of work for you.The  people living in this Residence work as though all the work here were  their own; therefore, night and day each of them is thinking, \'What is  there to be done? What can I do next?\' They do the work thinking that it  is their own work; therefore, it becomes their own. If you work with the thought, \'This is my work; this is my home,\' then it will become your home. If  you work only when you are being watched and become idle when not being  watched, then soon you will not be able to stay here as if it were your  home.This Residence needs as many hands as possible that work and none at all that do not work.\"\"Also, one time She taught us:\"\"Work (hataraku) makes those close to you comfortable; for that, it is called hataraku (hata: those nearby, raku: comfortable).\"\"\"','Anecdotes of Oyasama, pp. 154-155',154,NULL),(198,198,'198.

But this is not the  dust accumulated in your present life. It has been carried over from  your previous lives. God will surely save you. You must not change your heart. You must not let go of this string at any cost. Since you know nothing about your previous lives, just ask God for forgiveness and just thank God.\"\"From  that day on, Sei could not stay still when she thought of all the dust  that she had accumulated during her past three lives. Despite her swollen stomach, she went forth every day to do missionary work.Sei poured water over herself even on the coldest days in winter before going out. As people gradually began to come to her in increasing numbers, she would offer water in the sake  offering-bottle at the altar and then give it to them. By this means  marvelous healings took place one after another. For several years, she  went forth with zeal to do missionary work. But in the autumn of 1886,  when she was forty-nine years of age, her abdominal edema became worse  until she was in critical condition. She suffered so much that she  alternately said, \"\"Please let me sit up,\"\" and, \"\"Please let me lie down.\"\" Hisakichi  Hashida, who was the head of the confraternity, returned to Jiba.  Through the arrangement of Gisaburo Nakata he was granted an audience  with Oyasama, who said:\"\"Let  me lie down. Let me sit up. You must have heard her wrong. What she  meant was to enflame the confraternity with zeal. She will not die. Go  back quickly and perform the service sincerely.\"\"So  Hashida hurried back to Kobe. For three days and three nights, day and  night, six times in twenty-four hours, he performed a special prayer  service for her recovery.* The third day came but there was no sign of  improvement. Another  series of the special prayer service was performed for three days and  three nights, but her condition became worse. From the sixth day on, she  clenched her teeth and slept for twenty-eight days as if she had been  dead. During this period she was given sacred water daily, and three sacred sugar candies were cooked and given to her through a bamboo tube three times a day.The doctor refused to come, saying, \"\"She will die this time.\"\" However, during those twenty-eight days she urinated so frequently that it must have been over twenty times a day. On  the morning of the twenty-eighth day, her younger sister, Sue Nadatani,  was changing Sei\'s clothes. Sue noticed that her sister\'s swollen  stomach had shrunk to its normal size. She was so astonished that she shouted out. Hearing Sue\'s voice, Sei opened her eyes for the first time and looked around. Sue asked, \"\"Can you hear?\"\" Sei spoke for the first time, \"\"How thankful I am! How thankful I am!\"\"A thin rice gruel was cooked and given to her. She ate two mouthfuls and said, \"\"It is delicious. How thankful I am!\"\" She then ate two bowls of the gruel with some pickled plums. She ate grated yam next. Day by day Sei regained her strength. But she was just like a baby, wetting the bed, and her memory was very short.About  a month later, Kichigoro Kataoka, another official of the  [confraternity], returned to Jiba in her place to report it. He was  granted an audience with Oyasama, who said:\"\"It  is natural. It is natural. She is just one year old. She was reborn  without having to die. She is still young. She is only one. She does not  know anything yet. She will not know until she becomes two or three.\"\"Sei had lost her memory completely. When sewing a kimono, she would make mistakes in the measurement. She could no longer play the shamisen,  she was that bad. But within two or three years she gradually began to  understand things, and from the fourth year she was so blessed as to  lead a normal life.Thus,  Sei was given a second life at the age of forty-nine, and she lived on  for thirty years to the age of seventy-nine, devoting herself to saving  others with yet greater zeal.* This service consisted of the seated service and the entire teodori,  and was performed three times during the day and three times during the  night.

To elaborate, there was a portion in the THC program where we were asked to discuss Anecdotes 135 (\"\"With Round Minds\"\").I, being the pretentious translator that I am, was quick to point out the limitations of the phrase \"\"round minds\"\" and that its Japanese equivalent \"\"marui kokoro\"\" hinted at meanings that may not be immediately apparent in English.Two other people from my group then shared what they got from the story. The first person spoke of how the grapes symbolized that everyone in the world are somehow all connected. It also demonstrated the ideal for all members of humanity to live harmoniously, occupying the same relative space with one another.The second person perceptively contrasted the behavior of the child and his parents. While the boy\'s parents prostrated themselves in front of Oyasama, the boy, who was free and uncommitted to conforming to such social niceties, looked about in wonder and stared at the grapes sitting in front of him. She suggested that there was something in the boy\'s behavior that we could learn from as there is a tendency for us as members of a faith group to place excessive focus on formalities and outward appearances.I doubt I have given enough justice to the insight these two people happened to share then. But the point that I wish to make is that I came away with a sense that I was not giving Anecdotes (as flawed as it may be in some places as a translated text) the credit it is due. Even though there are portions that can certainly be improved to better reflect the Japanese original, the translation as it is now still has great potential to inspire those who seek insight from it.I began to wonder if my ability to read Anecdotes in its original language and my tendency to critique the way it was translated into English actually confines me to merely have a superficial understanding of it. I might also like to add that I obviously have a historicist bent/bias that may end up muddling things up even more than necessary.With this in mind, I hope that I have not made anyone feel compelled to accept anything I may have happened to write about a certain selection from Anecdotes to be authoritative or final in any way. Besides, I honestly don\'t remember most of what I have written, so the probability that I have internalized anything that I wrote about must be quite low. This goes for everything else I have done on this website. What I failed to fulfillI realize that since I dived into this project, I sort of diverged somewhat from what I initially set out to do. I recently reread the Intro to this series to remind myself of some of the things I originally planned to accomplish.One was to \"\"compare the current translation with the original Japanese and point out any portions that I feel require [sic] updating or improving.\"\" This really became less and less important as the project went along, I really didn\'t feel I had enough time to invest toward this initial objective all the time. I think this was all for the better, actually.I also wrote, \"\"since I do not really have the resources to check the \'veracity\' of each story, I\'ll just presume that they represent our best understanding of what occurred and what Oyasama said in certain situations unless I have a good reason to believe otherwise.\"\" Obviously, I utterly failed at this. As I limped forward the last months I just could not help but add in words/phrases such as \"\"allegedly,\"\" \"\"as described in,\"\" and \"\"portray.\"\" Would you call this a creeping agnosticism? I wouldn\'t know. I make a bad psychoanalyst.I also promised to do my best \"\"to pick up on the essential points\"\" of the teachings conveyed in each selection. I admittedly can\'t claim that I did this on a consistent basis.Finally, as the most glaring failure of all, I originally promised to \"\"include the full text of anecdotes that I feel are short enough while summarizing the longer ones\"\" (emphasis added). I fully revised the post where I originally wrote this. It now simply reads, \"\"Since I would like all potential visitors to Tenrikyology.com to know what I\'m blogging about, I\'ll include full texts of each selection.\"\"I ultimately proved to be too lazy to do any such summarizing on my part. I am glad I did not try to fulfill this promise. What\'s next?The quick answer to the question, \"\"What\'s next?\"\" honestly, is: Nothing. Nada. Zippo. I do not expect to begin any major project here on Tenrikyology.com for the rest of 2011 at least, maybe even for the foreseeable future. I may occasionally post an article if I feel inspired enough, but for the most part, I plan to take an extended break from working on this website.That being said, I also feel some housekeeping is long overdue on Tenrikyology.com. This includes edits here and there, updating/adding links, and so on. I may eventually get to doing this in the months ahead, but I am not making any promises.In the meantime, I plan to post periodically on Tenrikyo Resource (mostly translation work) and devote attention to adding pages to the Tenrikyo Resource Wiki.Thanks for reading, as always.\"','',160,NULL);
